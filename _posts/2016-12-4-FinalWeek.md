title: Final Week (11/28 - 12/4)
---
I can’t believe this semester has already come to an end! This week, I’m going to deviate from the regular conventional format and give an overall summary of my time in OOP, through the follow points:

## Lectures:
The lectures were definitely my most favorite part of the course. It was very different (annoying) in the beginning to run from across campus to be on time, but I got used to it very quickly. It was a great experience being tested each day on the material being taught in class, as I was always forced to go home and revise. This seemed very painful initially, but it was very helpful in keeping me prepared for the exams. The lecture content itself was extremely well documented and organized. I found it very easy to use the resources to revise.

## Projects:
The projects, for the most part, play an important role in providing a deeper understanding of the concepts we learn in class. The first two projects however, were not that great in my opinion. With netflix, I found it really hard to find the motivation behind the project. That being said, the last three projects were very good in explaining the key underlying concepts of the class. While doing these projects, I gained real experience of using the concepts we were learning in class in a practical setting.

## Exams:
The exams in this class are very fair, and test the knowledge in an unique way. You’re not excepted to memorize the small quirks being taught in class, but instead are tested on your ability to transform your understanding and knowledge of the C++ concepts into code. I found this method of testing to be challenging, yet interesting. One key addition that I would suggest is the presence of practice tests. As we don’t know the exact format of the exam, a practice test would help the students gain an understanding and recap the different material being taught in class. A couple of practice tests would go a long way in preparing the students mentally for what they’re about to be tested on.

## Conclusion:
This class was one of the most unique classes I’ve taken so far at UT. I gained in-depth knowledge about C++ and the industry, through the various projects (using the latest SWE tools) and tech talks that prof. Downing arranged. Although his policies of attendance and group work seemed painful in the beginning, I gained a lot by being constantly prepared and networking with different students throughout the course. I would like to conclude by recommending this class to any of my peers who’re interested in learning about the intricacies of C++ or the industry.
