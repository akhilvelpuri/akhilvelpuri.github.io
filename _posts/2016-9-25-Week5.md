title: Week 5 (9/19 - 9/25)
---
## Past week:
This past week has been the most grueling week of my undergraduate career. The career fair was a huge part of it, and I’m glad I spent a lot of time talking to many companies. I am also happy that I didn’t compromise on any of my course work, and did pretty well on all my midterms.

## In my way:
I have to start focusing on the OOP midterm which is coming up in a couple of weeks. For what I hear, the midterms in this class are very challenging. We have gone over a lot of C++ concepts, and it’s going to be a challenge to remember them all.

## Next week:
Apart from getting a head start on the OOP midterm preparations, I don’t have anything significant due in any of my classes this week. I hope to take advantage of this time and continue learning and refreshing my Java concepts for (hopefully) the interviews to come.

## Class experience:
This week we had a great talk by an employee from JPL. We learnt a lot about how the company plans, solidifies, and creates its software. Not only did we get an overview of the tools and practices used by JPL, but we also got to see a cool project which stitches the various images taken by the rover on Mars, to give scientists the ability to research efficiently. To cap it all off, we got a demo of how JPL uses VR headsets to re-create the conditions on Mars. It was an amazing talk!

## Tip of the week:
Coding on different environments is a very important skill. A person who is amazing at working on an IDE might struggle on a whiteboard, vice versa. My tip of the week is to get practice on all possible means of coding. Wether it is the whiteboard, or HackerRank, getting some experience on the most commonly tested environments alleviates the pressure and doubt of trying something new during interviews.
